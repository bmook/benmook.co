With a bachelor’s degree in psychology and a master’s in digital journalism, I love analyzing users’ online/mobile interactions and figuring out creative ways to improve their experiences. I am a superb team player and thrive on presenting outstanding work to great clients.

I completed the General Assembly UX Design Immersive program and the Visual Design for Web course. I am experienced in prototyping, user research, information architecture, and Lean and Agile workflows. I am proficient in Sketch, Axure, Keynote and Adobe Creative Suite.

**“Ben brings academic training in psychology and an impressive professional background in journalism to UX design. He is a copious note-taker and has an affable personality, both of which are clear assets, but his true strength lies in his ability to elicit information and to synthesize it and then apply it.”**
